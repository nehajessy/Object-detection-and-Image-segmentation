# YOLOv8 + SAM: Object Detection and Background Removal

This project demonstrates object detection and segmentation using YOLOv8 and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with Vision Transformer (ViT-H). After detecting and segmenting objects in an image, the background is removed, isolating the object of interest.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Detect objects in images using YOLOv8.
- **Segmentation**: Segment detected objects with SAM ViT-H.
- **Background Removal**: Remove the background while retaining only the detected object.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/YOLOv8-SAM-Background-Removal.git
   cd YOLOv8-SAM-Background-Removal
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install ultralytics
   pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git'
   ```

3. **Download SAM Model Checkpoint**:
   ```bash
   wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
   ```

## Usage

1. Place the image for object detection in the project directory (e.g., `input.jpg`).
2. Run the script to detect and segment objects:
   ```bash
   python obj.py
   ```
3. Output images with background removed are saved in the specified output folder.

## Project Overview

This project combines YOLOv8 and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to perform object detection, segmentation, and background removal in images. Using YOLOv8, the project detects objects within an image, while SAM efficiently segments these objects. The final output isolates the detected object by removing the background, providing a clear view of the subject. This can be useful for applications in image processing, computer vision, and various creative fields.
